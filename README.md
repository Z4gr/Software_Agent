This program is designed as a tool to gather and analyze data about various industries or sectors. It scrapes sectoral data from various online sources and presents it to the user.

I had developed this project with a team of 6 people. Initially, I was using my school email for GitHub benefits, but since access would be lost after the email was eventually deleted, I transferred it here. (I had completed the data visualization part)
